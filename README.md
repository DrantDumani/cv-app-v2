# Curriculum Vitae creator 2.0

A CV Creator made in React. This was made according to The Odin Project's [updated curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-cv-application).

The [previous version](https://github.com/DrantDumani/cv-app) of this project utilized React class components instead of hooks. It used deeply nested state and wasn't mobile responsive. This version intends to address all of these errors.
